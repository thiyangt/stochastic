\title{Plot a Markov Chain Transition Diagram}
\usage{
plot_markov_chain(P, state_names = NULL, threshold = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{P}{A numeric square matrix representing the transition probabilities
of the Markov chain. Each row should sum to 1.}

\item{state_names}{An optional character vector providing names for the states.
If NULL (default), states are labeled as "S1", "S2", ..., "Sn".}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value specifying the minimum transition probability
required to display an edge in the diagram. Default is 0.01.}
}
\value{
A plot of the Markov chain as a directed graph. Vertices represent
states, and edges represent transitions with probabilities above the threshold.
}
\description{
This function visualizes a Markov chain as a directed graph representing the
transition probabilities between states. Only transitions with probabilities
above a specified threshold are displayed.
}
\details{
This function relies on the following \code{igraph} functions:
\code{graph}, \code{V}, \code{E}, \code{plot}.
Users must ensure that the \code{igraph} package is installed and loaded.

Edge widths are scaled by the transition probability, and edge labels
display probabilities rounded to two decimal places.

\examples{
library(igraph)
P <- matrix(c(0.8, 0.2,
              0.1, 0.9), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
plot_markov_chain(P)

state_names <- c("Sunny", "Rainy")
plot_markov_chain(P, state_names, threshold = 0.05)
